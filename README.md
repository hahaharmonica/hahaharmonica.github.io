**Research Intern @ Université Paris Cité (_October 2018 – June 2019_)**  
Supervisor: Dr. Laurianne Cabrera  
- Designed EEG paradigms to test speech perception in infants and adults.  
- Conducted experiments and analyzed neural data for acoustic cue processing development.

**Research Assistant @ George Washington University (_March 2017 – August 2017_)**  
- Analyzed child-directed speech to study linguistic diversity and phonological phenomena.  

## Projects
### Interaction Between Speech and Auditory Processing During Early Phonological Development  
Developed a framework to study how infants’ phonological development is influenced by acoustic cue attunement. Conducted EEG experiments and behavioral paradigms, contributing novel insights into auditory processing. 

### Neural Development of Auditory Temporal Modulation  
Examined how temporal modulation impacts phonetic perception in infants and adults, utilizing electrophysiological data to uncover developmental trajectories.
