Whale hello there, I'm Monica üê≥



My Research Interests 
====
My research broadly focuses on how the brain processes sounds and how this influences cognitive and language development, particularly during early life and within a developmental framework.

How I Ended Up Here
====
I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how we learn languages. It all started during my senior year of high school when I became obsessed with learning French. Something about it felt so different from learning English (my native language) or Kannada (my parents‚Äô first language). This curiosity led me to wonder about the different ways in which we learn and process language.

A couple of years later, after some twists and turns, I decided to pursue a master‚Äôs in cognitive science, specializing in linguistics, with the goal of exploring my initial question further. During my master‚Äôs (which eventually turned into a PhD), I realized just how much we can learn by studying auditory processing. My broad question‚Äî"How do we learn languages?"‚Äîevolved into the more specific: "How do we process sounds?"

**‚ú® PhD Project**
For my PhD, under the supervision of **Laurianne Cabrera** and **Thierry Nazzi**, I investigated how infants process the acoustic components of speech sounds and how this shapes their phonological development. My research explored whether the acoustic cues in speech are processed and weighted similarly during infancy (at 6 and 10 months) and in adulthood.

**‚ú® Postdoc Project**
Currently, I am working with **Sahar Moghimi** to explore the brain‚Äôs early spontaneous activity using EEG and eye-tracking. My specific research focuses on investigating rhythm perception and processing in newborns born at term and at 6 months of age, to understand how these abilities develop during early infancy.
