üî¨ Research Experience
======
**Ph.D. @ Universit√© Paris Cit√© (_October 2020 ‚Äì December 2023_)**  
Supervisors: Dr. Thierry Nazzi and Dr. Laurianne Cabrera  
- Investigated the interaction between phonological attunement and acoustic cue attunement in infants.
- Designed and conducted behavioral and EEG experiments on infant and adult populations.  
- Processed and analyzed neural and acoustic data using Python and R.  
- Presented findings at international conferences, fostering interdisciplinary communication.

**Research Assistant @ √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (_August 2020 ‚Äì January 2020_)**  
Supervisor: Dr. Axelle Calcus  
- Recruited participants and conducted EEG and audiometry experiments on speech perception in noise.  

**Research Intern @ Universit√© Paris Cit√© (_October 2018 ‚Äì June 2019_)**  
Supervisor: Dr. Laurianne Cabrera  
- Designed EEG paradigms to test speech perception in infants and adults.  
- Conducted experiments and analyzed neural data for acoustic cue processing development.

**Research Assistant @ George Washington University (_March 2017 ‚Äì August 2017_)**  
- Analyzed child-directed speech to study linguistic diversity and phonological phenomena.
