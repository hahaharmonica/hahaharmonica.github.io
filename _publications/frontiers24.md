This study investigates how infants process spectro-temporal modulations in speech sounds to support phonological development. Using psychophysical methods, typical-hearing 6-month-olds, 10-month-olds, and adults were tested on their ability to detect changes in phonetic features when temporal modulations were selectively degraded. Findings suggest that between 6 and 10 months, infants show different developmental trajectories in the perceptual weight of speech temporal acoustic cues for vowel and consonant processing, possibly linked to phonological attunement.
