This study investigates the developmental changes in sensitivity to spectrotemporal cues for word form segmentation in infants aged 6 and 10 months. Using a psychoacoustic approach, the experiments degraded two fundamental acoustic components of speech—frequency modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM)—to evaluate their effects on segmentation.

**Key Findings**:
- 6-month-olds require FM (fast temporal modulation) cues for word form segmentation, while 10-month-olds do not.
- 10-month-olds can segment speech when AM cues are preserved in 16 spectral bands but fail when the number of bands is reduced to 8.
- The developmental shift between 6 and 10 months likely reflects an increased repertoire of segmentation strategies and/or a shift from a vowel to consonant processing bias.
